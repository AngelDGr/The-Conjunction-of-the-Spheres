Some creatures live in nests made from dirt and bones around the world.
The nest will host more and more monsters until it's destroyed.


A monster nest it's very hard to break, and while it's well-known that a nest can be destroyed with an explosion,
some rumours say that can also be destroyed with an efficiency enchantment strong enough.

;;;;;

But breaking one has a reward, as monsters usually hide magic goods inside them.
