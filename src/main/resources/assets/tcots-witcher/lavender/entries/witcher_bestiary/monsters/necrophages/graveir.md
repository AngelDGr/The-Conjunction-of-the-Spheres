Graveirs are depraved, lecherous and treacherous bastards. 
They are one of the most massive necrophages, 
they have some bony combs on their head and short but cruel, 
thick claws.


Their teeth and thin tongue allow them to eat marrow â€” and the more rotten and rancid the marrow, 
the more it is to their liking.


;;;;;

The vile graveirs have cadaverine in their teeth, so anyone who engages one in battle beware

{red}**Behavior**{}

The Graveir is a formidable foe, capable of defeating seasoned warriors with powerful strikes that deliver significant knockback.

Thanks to the cadaverine stored in its teeth, it can apply this acid to its target, rapidly decaying both health and armor.


Its thick, resilient skin provides armor and high resistance to explosions, making it even tougher to defeat.

;;;;;

Despite its immense strength, the Graveir's slow speed can be exploited in combat, providing opportunities 
for skilled fighters to gain the upper hand and ultimately overcome this formidable adversary.
