Trolls are known for their surprising intelligence, and many travelers have bonded with them over the years.
The info gathered from these bonds is summarized here.

First of all, there are two ways to improve your standing with trolls:
by doing good things for other trolls to raise your overall reputation,
or by helping a specific troll to strengthen your friendship with it.


Trolls are protective of their own and will not hesitate to defend each other. 
If they see you attacking a __non-rabid__ troll, they will immediately dislike you.

Rock trolls have a fondness for amethyst shards, ice trolls prefer lapis lazuli and forest troll prefer copper ingots, 
and they may even offer items like rocks, ores, or enchanted books in exchange.

Trolls also love alcohol, honey, milk, and meat, gifting any of these will significantly boost your friendship. 


Earning their respect is the easiest by defending them from enemies.

Once you've befriended a troll, you can ask it to follow you, and it will fight on your behalf.
*They can be healed with meat.*

Trolls can be assigned to guard a spot, either by interacting with them or by using a stick in the ground.
They will guard this place against any nearby monster.

While following you, they can also be given any __pre-conjunction__ potion. To dismiss a troll, simply crouch and speak to it.
