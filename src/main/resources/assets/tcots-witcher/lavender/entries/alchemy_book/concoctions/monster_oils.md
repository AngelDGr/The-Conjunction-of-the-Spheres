The monster oils are strong but temporal additives that you can apply to your swords and axes,
these oils gave you more damage against some specific types of monster.


To apply these additives, hold your weapon with your main hand and the oil with your
offhand and use it, you also can apply them directly inside your inventory.

;;;;;

This added damage it's independent of any kind of enchantment your weapon could have.

;;;;;

Each oil has a number of uses, each use being one hit, these uses are going to go down 
with every hit you make with the weapon, __independently if the oil boosts your damage 
against your current target__.


Similar to [potions](^tcots-witcher:concoctions/potions), each type of oil has three 
levels;  *Normal*, *Enhanced* and *Superior*. Each one being stronger and having more uses 
than the last. They also can be [refilled](^tcots-witcher:alchemy_basics/refilling).
