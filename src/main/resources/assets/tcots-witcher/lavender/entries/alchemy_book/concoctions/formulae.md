Formulae are alchemical recipes for creating potions, oils and bombs.
Each formula lists the required ingredients and describes the type of base necessary to create the mixture.


These formulae can be found in different chests across the world or trading with villagers, __you need to know the recipe to be
able to craft the mixture.__
