When you create a potion, decoction or monster oil in the Alchemy Table you
left a lot of magic in the bottle, much more than with a potion
made with a Brewing Stand, those magic leftovers let you collect the
empty bottles and easily refill them.


So, you are probably asking; how I can refill my concoctions?

;;;;;

You have two ways to refill them:
- Using an Alchemy Table.
- By Sleeping. 

![](tcots-witcher:textures/gui/sprites/alchemy_almanac/entries/refilling/refilling_bottle.png,fit)

;;;;;

In the two cases, you need to have [alcohol](^tcots-witcher:alchemy_basics/basic_ingredients).


To use the Alchemy Table to refill your concoctions, just take some alcohol with your hand
and use it on the table.


To refill them by sleeping, you also need to have some kind of alcohol with you,
by staying in bed for a while the concoctions are going to refill automatically.
When you refill in this way, the __alcohest has priority for refilling over others__.

;;;;;

As note, each type of alcohol is different, and each one refill a different quantity of
concoctions:
