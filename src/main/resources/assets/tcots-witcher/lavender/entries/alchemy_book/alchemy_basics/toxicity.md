Post-conjunction potions have a unique and dangerous trait: {#41d331}toxicity{}.
This toxicity can be dangerous when it reaches high levels and can even kill you.


There are two types of toxicity:
- {#0e740a}Normal Toxicity{}: {black}This kind of toxicity comes from normal and splash [potions](^tcots-witcher:concoctions/potions) and slowly depletes over time.{}


;;;;;

- {#043a02}Decoction Toxicity{}:
  {black}This toxicity comes from drinking [decoctions](^tcots-witcher:concoctions/decoctions),
  and does not dissipate over time, only decreasing when the decoction effect wears off.{}

You have a maximum toxicity capacity, and if you exceed 75% of that capacity, you will start taking continuous damage.
If you surpass 90% of your capacity, this damage will become even worse.

;;;;;

If the potion you want to drink makes you exceed your maximum toxicity capacity, __you won't be able to drink it__.
Also, your toxicity can be completely depleted off by drinking milk or a White Honey potion.


Overall, toxicity prevents you from drinking too many potions,
but there are rumors that certain objects can increase your toxicity tolerance...
