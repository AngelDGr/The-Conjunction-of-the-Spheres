The decoctions are special, very strong potions made with [monsters mutagens](^tcots-witcher:alchemy_basics/basic_ingredients).

Similar to potions, they need to be drunk and they can be [refilled](^tcots-witcher:alchemy_basics/refilling),
however you only can carry one in one space and they can't be upgraded.


The [toxicity levels](^tcots-witcher:alchemy_basics/toxicity) of decoctions are so high that usually you can only drink
one at the time, but the effects are so strong that you usually don't need more than that.
