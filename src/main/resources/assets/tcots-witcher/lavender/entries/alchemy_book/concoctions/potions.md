One of the most basics forms of alchemy it is the creation of potions,
and while potions made in a Brewing Stand are strong, the potions
made in the Alchemy Table can be even stronger.


These potions are a lot more expensive than a pre-conjunction potion,
but they have a lot of benefits compared to the normal ones.

;;;;;

First of all, they are more *portable*, so you can carry more than one in a single
space.

;;;;;

They can also be *[refilled](^tcots-witcher:alchemy_basics/refilling)*, so if you conserve the bottle
the crafting, it's only expensive the first time.


Of course, nothing this good and strong it's easy, they also have their own drawback; 
because they are significantly stronger, they have [toxicity levels](^tcots-witcher:alchemy_basics/toxicity) 
that can be dangerous to those that drink them, so your toxicity tolerance limits how many of these potions
you can drink at the time.

;;;;;

{red}Levels{}

Nearly each potion has three levels; *Normal*, *Enhanced* and *Superior*. Each one
being stronger than the last.

Each level not only increases the intensity of the effect, but also
the quantity you can carry in a single space.


{dark_blue}Splash variants{}

Contrary to pre-conjunction potions, these potions are made to being drunk, however, 
it's possible to create a splash variant.

;;;;;

Using gunpowder to create them, these splash versions have a max stack
of 5 and significantly less toxicity, but they can't be upgraded, and they have a shorter duration.
