One of the most basic forms of alchemy is the creation of potions,
and while potions made in a Brewing Stand are strong, the potions
made on the Alchemy Table can be even stronger.


These potions are a lot more expensive than pre-conjunction potions,
but they offer many benefits compared to the normal ones.

;;;;;

First of all, they are more *portable*, so you can carry more than one in a single
space.

;;;;;

They can also be *[refilled](^tcots-witcher:alchemy_basics/refilling)*, so if you conserve the bottle,
crafting it's only expensive the first time.


Of course, nothing this good and strong is easy.
They also have their own drawback; 
because they are significantly stronger, they have [toxicity levels](^tcots-witcher:alchemy_basics/toxicity)
that can be dangerous to those who drink them, 
so your toxicity capacity limits how many of these potions you can drink at once.

;;;;;

{red}Levels{}

Nearly each potion has three levels; *Normal*, *Enhanced* and *Superior*. Each one
 is stronger than the last.

Each level not only increases the intensity of the effect but also
the quantity you can carry in a single space.


{dark_blue}Splash variants{}

Contrary to pre-conjunction potions, these potions are made to be drunk; 
however, it's possible to create a splash variant.

;;;;;

Using gunpowder to create them, these splash versions have a max stack
of five and significantly less toxicity, but they can't be upgraded, and they have a shorter duration.
