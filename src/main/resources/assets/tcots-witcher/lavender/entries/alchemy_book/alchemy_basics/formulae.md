Formulae are alchemical recipes for creating potions, oils and bombs. 
Each formula lists the required ingredients and describes the type of base necessary to create the mixture.

These formulae can be discovered in various chests throughout the world or obtained by trading with villagers. 
__You must know the recipe in order to craft the concoction.__

;;;;;

The recipes for [decoctions](^tcots-witcher:concoctions/decoctions) can be only found in __Ancient Cities__.
