Bombs are thrown projectiles that you can use to supplement your combat. 
When thrown, Bombs produce a variety of effects, including dealing with damage in an area, 
hindering the abilities of monsters or inflicting crowd control effects on targets.
Similar to [potions](^tcots-witcher:concoctions/potions), each type of bomb has three
levels;  *Normal*, *Enhanced* and *Superior*.

;;;;;

Once they are used, you can use the remaining powder to [remade them](^tcots-witcher:alchemy_basics/refilling).
